# tiltTable
Code for my PHYS 4410 skill/project section of the course. 

Project is making a platform that can orient itself at any angle. Use cases include solar panels, directional antenaas etc. 

Code includes Julia code to go from disired table orinetation given in elevation and azimuth to the two servo angles. Implimented 2D bisection algorthim using winding numbers to solve. 

C++ code is for RP2040 to control the servo motors
